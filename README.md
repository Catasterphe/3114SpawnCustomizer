# 3114 Spawn Customizer (originally Always3114)

This is my first plugin made with Northwood PluginAPI as well as 0harmony.dll - used for controlling the spawning of SCP 3114 in your game. Below are the available settings and their descriptions:\

# Default Config Values
```yaml
# The Minimum number of players that have to be in the game for 3114 to spawn every round.
minimum_number_of_players: 6
# If true, Allow players already selected to be SCP's to spawn as 3114 instead.
allow_scps: true;
# if true, only lets players already selected to be scps to spawn as 3114.
only_scps: false;
# The chance for scp 3114 to spawn, 0 = 0%, 1 = 100%
chance_to_spawn: 1
```
